# Welcome to PIZZA SLICE Project

## Why did you choose that project?

We choose https://pizzaslice.jp/ web site for our analytical project.
We liked the simple taste of design of this site.
However, there are several things we don't like and we thought there can be added several new features.  
We added these features

1. fixed header
2. floating menu icon
3. hiding menu images for mobile version.

## How did you divide the work between team members?

We don't want to conflict with each other's task so primarily separate tasks between each page. We divided work as follows.

| P.I.C.   | PAGE    |
| -------- | ------- |
| Masahiro | index   |
| Kanta    | menu    |
| Masahiro | contact |
| Kanta    | login   |

Masahiro handles index and contact pages. He thought overlaying paragraph onto an image is charenging task and wanted to learn how to do it. And alse charged with adding zoom-out animation for images.

Kanta handles menu and login pages. He tried to implement floating hamburger menu with pure html, css and javascript. He also created mobile version of menu page with taste of cacutus club cafe web site, which is hiding menu images when seen from a mobile.

As for common parts, such like header or footer, we separate scss files so that we could use it for all the pages.  
(See components folder!!)

## What you learned and what you struggled the most
